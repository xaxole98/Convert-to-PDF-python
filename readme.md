# Document Converter

This is a Python script that converts various document formats to PDF. It supports conversion from Microsoft Word documents (`.doc`, `.docx`) and plain text files (`.txt`) to PDF.

## Installation

1. Install the required Python packages:
    ```
    pip install PyPDF2
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the script using Python:
    ```
    python document_converter.py
    ```

2. A file selection dialog will open. Select the document file you want to convert.

3. The script will convert the document to PDF and save it in the same directory as the script.

4. After the conversion is complete, a message will be printed.

Note: The script relies on LibreOffice to convert Word documents to PDF. Make sure you have LibreOffice installed on your system.

Feel free to customize the script according to your needs :p.
